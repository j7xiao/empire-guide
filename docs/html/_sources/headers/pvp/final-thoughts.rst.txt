Final Thoughts
===============

There is still random loose bits that still need to be tied up.

If you are reading this sentence, go poke commcl to finish this guide out.

:blue:`Defending Weak Attacks`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the defender is significantly stronger then the attacker, he typically wants to kill off the courtyard assault. He must leave a flank "open" (assigning 0% of the wall trops to a flank), otherwise if he wins all three flanks, the attacker's courtyard assault is simply returned to the attacker. Naturally, the defender will lose more troops then if he simply defended all three flanks, but sometimes it's about sending a message.

:blue:`42-shield Attack Strategy`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use :number:`3` waves of :number:`42` shields, the defender will see :number:`126` shields, which can bait him into thinking there are :number:`4` waves of shields instead of :number:`3`. This may lure him into using less ranged defenders and weakening his defense.

Obviously :number:`126` is not divisible by :number:`4`, so that's typically a good indicator that it's a bluff. Someone could manually change the shield amount for each wave, but shield waves are essentially cannon fodder to begin with. No one is trying to add more of them onto their attack.

Also there are some people that strictly send out :number:`42` shields. Either way it's suboptimal, but worth addressing.
