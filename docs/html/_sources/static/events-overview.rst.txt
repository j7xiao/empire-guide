Overview
--------

Events represent the backbone of activity in Goodgame Empire. They typically appear as tents beneath your castle and offer meaningful rewards in exchange for specific services. All events are recurring to some degree, but one must capitalize quickly on each duration to beat out your fellow competitors and win the most rewards!

Some events are denoted by their relative complexity (:ref:`primary events<Primary Events>`), hence the need for a more in-depth guide. All events are listed below, but only some of them have dedicated guides. The rest (:ref:`other events<Other Events>`) have more simplified sections as they tend to be more self explanatory.
