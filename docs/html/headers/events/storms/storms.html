<h1>The Storm Islands<a class="headerlink" href="#the-storm-islands" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The Storm Islands is a monthly alliance-based event set in its unique world map accessible from the kingdom overview. In this event, alliances and individual players compete to amass the highest cargo points. The Storm Islands event has a duration of one month, consistently resetting on the 1st day of each month at 4:30AM UTC.</p>
<p>At the end of the storm islands event, the top 5 alliances earn special rewards. Additionally, the top 10 players with the most cargo points within these alliances will earn various storm titles based on their ranking. These titles bestow benefits upon their holders for the duration of the month (until the next Storm Islands event comes to a close).</p>
<p>After the event, the entire Storm Islands map is cleared of players, and access to the islands is restricted until the next event cycle begins. All assets return to the main castles. It’s important to note that any aquamarines you accumulate during this event won’t carry over to the next one and must be spent before the event draws to a close.</p>
<section id="event-currency">
<h2><span class="blue">Event currency</span><a class="headerlink" href="#event-currency" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In the Storm Islands event, a unique resource known as aquamarine takes center stage. The main goal of the event is to collect aquamarine through different methods and use it to either purchase individual rewards or convert it into additional cargo points by constructing more boats. Aquamarine has multiple uses, including trading it for PO items, sceats, equipment, constructing boats, etc.</p>
<p>You can also utilize aquamarine to construct or upgrade “cargo ships” within your Storm Island castle. Each cargo ship or upgrade contributes ‘cargo points’ to your alliance, and the collective cargo points determine the alliance’s reward at the end of the month. Having more participants in the event benefits the alliance as a whole. Cargo points serve no other purpose besides determining your alliance’s ranking in the event.</p>
<p>Aquamarine can be obtained from four sources (In terms of ease of acquisition):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Seizing aquamarine islands;</p></li>
<li><p>Launching attacks on storm forts;</p></li>
<li><p>Completing quests;</p></li>
<li><p>Expanding your walls.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that none of your resources, including aquamarine, carry over to the next month’s event. Consequently, it’s advisable to spend any accumulated aquamarine before the end of the month.</p>

<h2><span class="blue">When should you join?</span><a class="headerlink" href="#when-should-you-join" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Your strategy in this event depends on when you entered it. Joining early places you in the middle of the world map, while entering after a few days positions you near the map’s edge. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages.
Each storm fort can sustain a maximum of 10 attacks before sinking, irrespective of which player initiated the attacks. Once you successfully defeat a storm fort, it goes on cooldown, and you won’t be able to attack it until the cooldown period expires. Typically, these forts are often sunk by other players before the cooldown ends, but this outcome depends on the strategy you selected in the section below.</p>
<p>Starting in the middle of the map means you’re closer to more storm forts, offering better proximity. However, it also means these forts will be attacked frequently by other players, and you might not reach them in time before they’re sunk. When spawning in the middle it is not advisable to go for storm forts that are close to sinking or a great distance away.  I specifically target storm forts that have a minimum of 3 out of 10 attacks remaining before they sink. This approach allows me to maximize my chances of successfully defeating the fort before they get sunk by other players.
Conversely, spawning at the map’s edge puts you much further from the majority of early joining players. This approach almost ensures you can target each storm fort before they’re taken down.
The key to success lies in carefully considering both the distance to the fort and the number of attempts left before making your decision on whether to engage and attempt to defeat it.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-started">
<h2><span class="blue">Getting started</span><a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Starting in the Storm Islands, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. The right way to begin depends on your activity level and objectives. However, here’s my personal step-by-step guide that can be effective for earning both individual rewards through aquamarine and alliance rewards with cargo points.</p>
<p>Start by completing the initial quest, which requires sending over 25 attack troops along with shield walls and defensive tools. Additionally, transfer over as much wood and stone as possible. During this initial construction phase, I recommended to utilize your hero with the highest construction speed bonus on your storm castellan.
Next, prioritize the upgrade of your storehouse, followed by sending over more resources. Upgrade your keep for faster building speeds and expand your castle walls. Using time skips to expedite the upgrade time can help you complete several keep upgrades and storehouse upgrades on your first day in the event.
Construct at least one level 2 cargo ship, as it provides an additional 2,000 aquamarine for every 25,000 aquamarine you earn from raiding storm forts in the form of completable quests.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to upgrade your harbor to at least level 2 to effectively hunt aquamarine islands. Without it, you’ll likely have limited success. If you prefer not to or can’t spend rubies on harbor upgrades, an alternative strategy is to farm aquamarine by defeating storm forts. Keep in mind that defeating storm islands is slower than hunting the large aquamarine islands, but it’s still a viable approach, particularly for beginners and/or free-to-play players.
In the long run, you’ll require additional storehouse and castle space if you intend to maintain a substantial army and place a substantial amount of cargo ships.
While the amount of wood, stone, and food that you can hold and transport to your castle is limited by your storehouse’s capacity, looting these resources from resource islands has no such limit. For instance, you can accumulate well over the max 80.000 storage limit for wood/stone by capturing wood and stone resource islands. This is a great method to obtain enough resources to expand your walls without the need to spend time or rubies upgrading your storehouse to its maximum level.</p>
</section>
<section id="storm-forts">
<h2><span class="blue">Storm forts</span><a class="headerlink" href="#storm-forts" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Storm Forts serve a similar purpose to Robber Barons in the Great Empire. When attacked or looted, they yield food, wood, and stone, with aquamarine replacing coins as their primary resource. The quantity of each resource you can plunder depends on the fort’s level, your commander’s loot bonus, your HOL perks, the marauder and most other percentage increases to additional loot plundered.. Given the relatively modest food production, you might consider these forts as a source of food.</p>
<p>Attacking storm forts primarily yields aquamarine, although you do earn some cargo points for defeating them. It’s worth noting that the cargo points gained from storm forts are very negligible.</p>
<p>When engaging storm forts, it’s advisable to concentrate your efforts on targeting level 80 and level 70 fortresses. Interestingly, there’s no distinction in the amount of aqua you acquire between the weaker and stronger versions of these forts. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that launching attacks against a stronger variant will result in higher casualties. Personally, I adopt a strategy of attacking both the weaker and stronger variants of level 80 forts and both versions of level 70 forts if they happen to be nearby.
There are two effective strategies I subscribe to when attacking storm forts. The first strategy is accessible to all players, regardless of their level. The second strategy, while potentially more efficient, relies on specific key factors to function optimally. It may require certain conditions to be met for its successful implementation.</p>
</section>
<section id="first-strategy-storm-forts">
<h2><span class="blue">First strategy (storm forts)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#first-strategy-storm-forts" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The first strategy involves attacking both level 70 and 80 forts on all three flanks, whether they are weak or strong versions of the fort. Your primary focus should be on level 80 forts, but it’s also essential to keep an eye out for nearby level 70 forts. For this strategy, recruit only ranged troops, with veteran heavy crossbows being the preferred choice due to their strength relative to their cost. Additionally, you can recruit them for free if you have a high-level “Recruitment Cost” build item. This strategy can be used without the need to spy the target.
Utilize a commander hero with the “Mantlet Travel Speed When Attacking” attribute, combined with wooden ladders, rams, and mantlets. This combination effectively negates the slow travel speed of the wooden mantlets, ensuring they move as fast as the troops you send. As an alternative, you can use ruby mantlets like “shieldwall” with a significantly higher travel speed. If you don’t have a commander hero with the mantlet travel speed attribute or one is not available.</p>
<p><span class="orange">Option 1:</span> Commander Hero with Mantlet Travel Speed Attribute:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On the left and right flank: Send 10 wooden ladders and 30 mantlets.</p></li>
<li><p>In the middle: Send 10 wooden ladders, 10 wooden rams, and 30 mantlets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="orange">Option 2:</span> Commander Hero without Mantlet Travel Speed Attribute:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>On the flanks: Send 10 wooden ladders and 15 shield walls.</p></li>
<li><p>In the middle: Send 10 wooden ladders, 10 wooden rams, and 18 shield walls.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using the second strategy, where you don’t have the commander hero with the mantlet travel speed attribute, you could opt to conserve some tools by attacking via the middle and one flank (left or right) instead of attacking all three flanks.</p>
</section>
<section id="second-strategy-aqua-islands">
<h2><span class="blue">Second strategy (aqua islands)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#second-strategy-aqua-islands" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The second strategy hinges on having an artifact with the attribute “Supported by ### Shield-maiden in the courtyard attack”. Additionally, this strategy relies on using units with a high travel speed. Think of the renegade kunai thrower from the samurai shop and the default macemen. However, if you’ve already researched the ability to recruit their veteran counterparts, you won’t be able to utilize the default macemen.
Default macemen are the fastest units, but using them will lead to a significantly higher number of casualties. In contrast, renegade kunai throwers are slower but can substantially reduce the amount of casualties thanks to their high attack power.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that you should avoid using the renegade stone smasher from Luna’s trade boat. While they may be cost-effective, these troops are not a practical choice as they perish after a single attack, regardless if you won or lost. Relying solely on renegade stone smashers in your attack will lead to the storm fort going on cooldown without any troops or loot returning to your castle.</p>
<p>This approach involves spying the small and big aqua islands to identify the outer flank with the weakest defense. Once determined, you will pack all your waves full of your highest travel speed units.
If you are uncertain about your ability to defeat either the left or right flank, you have the alternative option of targeting the middle flank. Opting for the middle flank enables you to deploy a larger number of soldiers, but this choice may result in a higher amount of casualties.</p>
<p>This strategy can prove more efficient when compared to the first one, but it does come with certain prerequisites. To make this strategy work optimally, you need to have the capability to recruit default macemen or utilize renegade kunai thrower , and you should possess a substantial number of commanders with the artifact attribute “Supported by ### Shield-maiden in the courtyard attack.”</p>

<p>Storm forts have a consistent number of defenders within them, which can be determined by checking the number of guards present in level 60, 70, or 80 forts. This method can help you save your troops, coins, and fast travel feathers as there is no need to actually spy every storm fort individually. In summary, more guards equate to fewer defenders.</p>

<h2><span class="blue">Resource Islands</span><a class="headerlink" href="#resource-islands" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When you capture a resource island (wood, stone, or aquamarine), you must ‘occupy’ it. The duration of this occupation period varies depending on the resource type and size, ranging from 4 hours to 18 hours. Once the occupation period ends, the resources sail back to your island. After being occupied, the resource islands disappear but reappear in the same spot as before, typically within one to three days. It’s a good idea to bookmark them for quick access. Notably, the small aquamarine islands respawn 32 hours after disappearing, while the large aquamarine islands respawn 72 hours after disappearing.</p>

<p>The defense on Aqua islands is more substantial compared to the wood and stone islands, with larger islands having stronger defenses than the smaller ones. Notably, the large Aqua islands have only slightly better defenses than the small ones but provide a substantial +450% more Aqua. As a result, they are certainly worth pursuing if you come across them and can secure them first. It becomes a race to claim them as soon as they appear. A level two harbors or higher is highly recommended if you’re pursuing aqua islands.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to keep in mind the following unwritten rule: island possession is determined on a first-come, first-served basis. Islands are highly unlikely to be stolen from you on purpose. If someone manages to capture an island before you do, it’s advisable to recall your attackers from that island and leave a single soldier, making it easy for the original player to recapture it from you.</p>
<p>If you’re striving for the highest level of optimization, using spreadsheets to track the timing and locations of aqua island respawns can be a valuable tool. To gain a deeper understanding of this process, you can refer to this

<h2><span class="blue">Cargo ships</span><a class="headerlink" href="#cargo-ships" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can construct cargo ships to boost your cargo points. These ships occupy the same space as a 5x10 tile decoration. Cargo ships can be upgraded up to level 10, but it’s generally more efficient to upgrade them gradually and evenly, as the upgrade time significantly increases compared to the cargo points you receive for each level. For instance, it’s a good strategy to level up all your cargo ships to level 2 before upgrading any of them to level 3. This approach is the most time-to-cargo-point efficient strategy.</p>
